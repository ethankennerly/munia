# TODO: Fix Bugs

The worst user experience is the priority to fix. Sorted by priority first:

- [ ] Entering text for post with about 100 lines did not display the post button on screen. It went up off the top of the screen.
- [ ] Long unbroken word in text of post was not wrapped. Part of the word went off the right side of the screen.
- [ ] When clicking the feed section Create Post Image/Video button directly, an image to a post showed the operating system file modal, but did not really attach the image. Only after the Create Post modal was opened did the Image/Video button again display an operating system file selection modal and correctly attach an image.
- [ ] When selecting an image at 4KB x 4KB or larger the image failed to be attached. The failure is acceptable. But the message was unclear what the cause was.
