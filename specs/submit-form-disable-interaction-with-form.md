# Submit Form: Disable Interaction with Form

Edit Profile Form has several fields. The user clicked Submit. The user rapidly clicked an input field. 

## Expected Results

The form should be disabled immediately after the user clicks "Submit", preventing any further interaction with the form fields until the server responds.

## Actual Results

The form remains interactive after the user clicks "Submit", allowing them to click on input fields or buttons, which can lead to confusion or unintended consequences while waiting for the server response.
