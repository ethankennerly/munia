Minimal Viable Product:
- The open tech spec is written as a to-do list of tasks with checkboxes.
- The lines of the open tech spec are sorted in order priority.
- ALWAYS read the open tech spec starting from line 1.
- ALWAYS focus on the first unchecked action item.
- ALWAYS follow rules of @.cursor/rules/tdd.mdc
- If verified, check the box at that unchecked action item.
