## Pass the failing test

Implement the **simplest correct solution** that makes all tests pass.

Rules:
- Simplest code that makes tests pass
- No edits unrelated to failing tests
- No speculative abstractions
- No premature optimization
- No comments
- All lint passes
- All tests pass
- Build passes
- Limit output to user input prompt name followed by 1 to 50 characters that summarize status.
